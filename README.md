## üéµ Quick Start

Just run the launcher script for the easiest experience:

```bash
./launch.sh
```

This gives you all the options you need to start composing, analyzing, and managing your AI-generated music.

## üéπ Features

- **Multiple Music Styles**: Create compositions in classical, jazz, pop, rock, or electronic styles
- **AI-Suggested Parameters**: Let the AI choose appropriate musical parameters for coherent compositions
- **Custom Control**: Specify your own key, tempo, instruments, and more if you prefer
- **Multi-Style Generation**: Generate compositions in all styles at once to compare them
- **MIDI Analysis**: Examine the structure of any MIDI composition 
- **Composition Combining**: Merge multiple compositions either sequentially or layered

## üìã Using the Tools

### Interactive Launcher

Run the interactive launcher for the simplest experience:

```bash
./launch.sh
```

### Generate a Quick Composition

For a fast composition with AI-suggested parameters:

```bash
./run_composer.sh
```

This will:
1. Generate a composition with AI-suggested parameters
2. Save it as `ai_composition.mid`
3. Analyze the composition structure

### Custom Composition

To create a composition with your own parameters:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then select option 1 and follow the prompts to specify:
- Tempo (BPM)
- Key (C, D, E, F, G, A, B with optional # or b)
- Mode (major or minor)
- Style (classical, jazz, pop, rock, electronic)
- Duration (in seconds)
- Instruments (comma-separated list)
- Chord complexity (0.0-1.0)
- Rhythm variation (0.0-1.0)

### Generate in Multiple Styles

To create compositions in all available styles:

```bash
./explore_styles.sh
```

### Analyze a MIDI File

To examine the structure of a MIDI file:

```bash
python analyze_midi.py your_file.mid
```

### Combine MIDI Files

To merge multiple compositions together:

```bash
python combine_midi.py
```

This tool allows you to combine files either:
- **Sequentially**: Play one composition after another
- **Layered**: Play all compositions simultaneously

### Play a MIDI File

To attempt playback (requires proper audio setup):

```bash
python play_music.py your_file.mid
```

Note: Playback requires Timidity configuration which may not be available in all environments.
